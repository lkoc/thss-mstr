In order to take wind turbines into account in the {LBM} solver, {LaBoheMe} is enhanced by the addition of local force terms representing the influence of the wind turbines on the flow. These forces are computed using an Actuator-Line Model ({ALM}). The present solver is a 2D {LBM}/{ALM} solver allowing the simulation of “slices” of a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine ({VAWT}).

The proposed scheme consists of active and passive {FRT} compensators. The active compensator is carried out by determining the rotor current references to reduce the rotor over voltages. The passive compensator is based on rotor current limiter ({RCL}) that considerably reduces the rotor inrush currents at the instants of occurring and clearing the grid faults with deep sags. By applying the proposed strategy, negative effects of the grid faults in the {DFIG} system including the rotor over currents, electromagnetic torque oscillations and {DC}-link over voltage are decreased.

	abstract = {Wind energy has become the world’s fastest growing energy source. Although wind farm layout is a well known problem, its solution used to be heuristic, mainly based on the designer experience. A key in search trend is to increase power production capacity over time. Furthermore the production of wind energy often involves uncertainties due to the stochastic nature of wind speeds. The addressed problem contains a novel aspect with respect of other wind turbine selection problems in the context of wind farm design. The problem requires selecting two different wind turbine models (from a list of 26 items available) to minimize the standard deviation of the energy produced throughout the day while maximizing the total energy produced by the wind farm. The novelty of this new approach is based on the fact that wind farms are usually built using a single model of wind turbine. This paper describes the usage of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms ({MOEAs}) in the context of power energy production, selecting a combination of two different models of wind turbine along with wind speeds distributed over different time spans of the day. Several {MOEAs} variants belonging to the most renowned and widely used algorithms such as {SPEA}2 {NSGAII}, {PESA} and {msPEA} have been investigated, tested and compared based on the data gathered from Cancun (Mexico) throughout the year of 2008. We have demonstrated the powerful of {MOEAs} applied to wind turbine selection problem ({WTS}) and estimate the mean power and the associated standard deviation considering the wind speed and the dynamics of the power curve of the turbines. Among them, the performance of {PESA} algorithm looks a little bit superior than the other three algorithms. In conclusion, the use of {MOEAs} is technically feasible and opens new perspectives for assisting utility companies in developing wind farms.},

Finally, a sample wind farm consisting of 16 turbines is used as a case study and the results show that there is a noticeable increase in the amount of wind farm output power rather than the time which no control and optimization is used. The conclusion is that the presented algorithm is suitable for wind farms with high wake losses and little distance between their turbines and is very effective for increasing their output power.},

In this paper, the tower height matching problem in wind turbine positioning optimization is studied, based on the wind speed characteristics of the site, the wind turbine power curve, the linear turbine wake ﬂow model and the cost model. The global greedy algorithm with repeated adjustment is employed to solve the wind turbine positioning optimization problem. The Turbine-Site Matching Index ({TSMI}) is introduced as the objective function, with the consideration of the height effects both on the capacity factor ({CF}) and the initial capital cost ({ICC}). A normalized power output (L) is deﬁned to analyze the matching problem. The optimal tower height is obtained through modeling L. The power curve model with and without power control mechanisms are studied. The computational results indicate that the proposed method can obtain the approximated optimal height in short computational time. The height effects on the wake ﬂow and the distances among turbines reduce the optimal height. For the whole turbine layout, the higher tower heights are not always desirable for optimality. There exists an optimal tower height when maximizing {TSMI}.},

	abstract = {For wind farm layout optimization process, a simple linear model has been mostly used for considering the wake effect of a wind turbine on its downstream turbines. In this model, the wind velocity in the wake behind a turbine is obtained as a function of turbine induction factor which was considered to be 0.324 almost in all the previous studies. However, it is obviously evident that this factor is a strong function of turbine blade geometry and operational conditions. In the present study, a new method is introduced by which the induction factor for wind turbines can be calculated based on the method of Blade Element Momentum theory. By this method, the effect of blade proﬁle, wind speed and angular velocity of wind turbine on the induction factor can be easily taken into account. The results show that for different blade proﬁles and operational conditions, the induction factor differs from the single value used so far. Also it is shown that this difference has a very signiﬁcant effect in calculated gained power from a wind farm. It is clearly seen that considering the new method for calculating an appropriate induction factor affects the total calculated power generation of a wind farm and consequently inﬂuences the farm layout in optimization process.},

In this scheme, the input mechanical energy of the wind turbine during grid fault is stored and utilized at the moment of fault clearance, instead of being dissipated in the resistors of the crowbar circuit as in the existing {FRT} schemes. Consequently, torque balance between the electrical and mechanical quantities is achieved and hence the rotor speed deviation and electromagnetic torque ﬂuctuations are reduced. This results in reduced reactive power requirement and rapid reestablishment of terminal voltage on fault clearance. Furthermore, the stored electromagnetic energy in the inductor is transferred into the dc link capacitor on fault clearance and hence the grid side converter is relieved from charging the dc link capacitor, which is very crucial at this moment, and this converter can be utilized to its full capacity for rapid restoration of terminal voltage and normal operation of {DFIG}. Extensive simulation study carried out employing {PSCAD}/{EMTDC} software vividly demonstrates the potential capabilities of the proposed scheme in enhancing the performance of {DFIG} based wind farms to fault ride-through.},

	abstract = {The optimal arrangement of wind turbines plays a signiﬁcant role in obtaining the expected output power from wind farms. This paper addresses challenges related to typical restriction assumptions of turbine arrangement in wind farms with candidate selection approach. An applicable hybrid (quadratic assignment problem-genetic algorithm) evolutionary method with an initial candidate points selection ({ICPS}) approach is proposed and applied to four case studies to obtain optimal layout designs with maximum efﬁciency. The current study considers not only the previously utilized indicators found in the literature, such as wake effects, turbine hub height and rotor diameter, but also accounts for additional criteria such as the load-bearing capacity of soil and restrictions regarding the existence of prohibited places as well as varying wind velocities and directions. This is done to make the approach more applicable for realistic cases, and also to incorporate the preferences of expert designers. The results suggest that superior performance is attained with the proposed algorithm compared to previous similar studies. An efﬁciency improvement of about 3\% is achieved for case one, and the algorithm provides reasonable optimal wind farm design layouts for cases two, three, and four where more restrictions exist.},

To address the dramatic voltage ﬂuctuations and wind turbine generators ({WTGs}) cascading trip faults, which have been greatly challenged the wind pool area’s operation, a hierarchical automatic voltage control system to support wind power integration (Wind-{AVC}) is designed and presented in this paper. For each wind farm, an autonomous wind farm voltage controller ({WFVC}), which takes the details of the wind farm side grid into account, is applied to optimize the voltage and reactive power distribution inside the wind farm. Three different control modes are implemented to consider all the terminal voltages of {WTGs} as well as the dynamic Var reserves. A control center voltage controller ({CCVC}) is designed to coordinate all the distributed {WFVCs}. A security-constrained optimal power ﬂow ({SCOPF}) based preventive control is presented, which ensures all the wind farms’ voltage satisfying the operational constraints for all the possible N − 1 scenarios. The Wind-{AVC} system has been put into operation in Northern China and was found to be effective in mitigating the voltage ﬂuctuations and reducing the cascading trip risks.},

Firstly, the optimal power point of each turbine is tracked in such a way that the total output power of the wind farm is also smoothed. Secondly, the proposed scheme enables the wind farm to produce a predetermined output power. To show the performance of the proposed scheme, a doubly fed induction generator ({DFIG}) based wind farm is simulated and the results are compared with conventional scheme.

The model considers wake loss, which can be calculated based on wind turbine locations, and wind direction. Since the turbine layout design is a constrained optimization problem, for ease of solving it, the constraints are transformed into a second objective function. Then a multi-objective evolutionary strategy algorithm is developed to solve the transformed bi-criteria optimization problem, which maximizes the expected energy output, as well as minimizes the constraint violations. The presented model is illustrated with examples as well as an industrial application.},

The approach uses a dynamic overset computational ﬂuid dynamics ({CFD}) code for the aerodynamics coupled with a multi-body dynamics ({MBD}) code for the motion responses to the aerodynamic loads. Mann's wind turbulence model was implemented into the {CFD} code as boundary and initial conditions. The wind turbulence model was validated by comparing the theoretical one-point spectrum for the three components of the velocity ﬂuctuations, and by comparing the expected statistics from the {CFD} simulated wind turbulent ﬁeld with the explicit wind turbulence inlet boundary from Mann model. Extensive simulations based on the proposed coupled approach were conducted with the conceptual {NREL} 5-{MW} offshore wind turbine in an increasing level of complexity, analyzing the turbine behavior as elasticity, wind shear and atmospheric wind turbulence are added to the simulations. Results are compared with the publicly available simulations results from {OC}3 participants, showing good agreement for the aerodynamic loads and blade tip deﬂections in time and frequency domains. Wind turbulence/turbine interaction was examined for the wake ﬂow. It was found that explicit turbulence addition results in considerably increased wake diffusion. The coupled {CFD}/{MBD} approach can be extended to include multibody models of the shaft, bearings, gearbox and generator, resulting in a promising tool for wind turbine design under complex operational environments.},

	abstract = {Wind farm ({WF}) layout optimization is to ﬁnd the optimal positions of wind turbines ({WTs}) inside a {WF}, so as to maximize and/or minimize a single objective or multiple objectives, while satisfying certain constraints. In this work, a random search ({RS}) algorithm based on continuous formulation is presented, which starts from an initial feasible layout and then improves the layout iteratively in the feasible solution space. It was ﬁrst proposed in our previous study and improved in this study by adding some adaptive mechanisms. It can serve both as a reﬁnement tool to improve an initial design by expert guesses or other optimization methods, and as an optimization tool to ﬁnd the optimal layout of {WF} with a certain number of {WTs}. A new strategy to evaluate layouts is also used, which can largely save the computation cost. This method is ﬁrst applied to a widely studied ideal test problem, in which better results than the genetic algorithm ({GA}) and the old version of the {RS} algorithm are obtained. Second it is applied to the Horns Rev 1 {WF}, and the optimized layouts obtain a higher power production than its original layout, both for the real scenario and for two constructed scenarios. In this application, it is also found that in order to get consistent and reliable optimization results, up to 360 or more sectors for wind direction have to be used. Finally, considering the inevitable inter-annual variations in the wind conditions, the robustness of the optimized layouts against wind condition changes is analyzed, and the optimized layouts consistently show better performance in power production than the original layout, despite of considerable variations in wind direction and speed.},

The flow fields are obtained based on a steady {CFD} model with the discrete inflow wind conditions as the boundary conditions, and a database is established containing the important parameters including the inflow wind conditions, the flow fields and the corresponding wind power for each wind turbine. The power is predicted via the database by taking the Numerical Weather Prediction ({NWP}) wind as the input data. In order to evaluate the approach, the short-term wind power prediction for an actual wind farm is conducted as an example during the period of the year 2010. Compared with the measured power, the predicted results enjoy a high accuracy with the annual Root Mean Square Error ({RMSE}) of 15.2\% and the annual {MAE} of 10.80\%. A good performance is shown in predicting the wind power’s changing trend. This approach is independent of the historical data and can be widely used for all kinds of wind farms including the newly-built wind farms. At the same time, it does not take much computation time while it captures the local air flows more precisely by the {CFD} model. So it is especially practical for engineering projects.},

The blades, which not only account for 20\% of the total wind turbine cost, but also have much inﬂuence on the wind turbine life, are important components of wind turbines. With the stress analysis of blade roots in four different load conditions, this paper establishes a mathematic model quantifying damage of the blades and its relationship with blade life. The relationship between generator losses and reactive power is also established according to the generator losses of wind turbines. Moreover, based on the theory of binary particle swarm algorithm, genetic algorithm and {GA}-{IBPSO} algorithm, three optimal power dispatch models are proposed. The models take wind power prediction and load demand of electrical system into consideration and the objective of the optimization are to minimize the blade damage and generator losses. Application of the proposed optimal dispatching model in a 49.5 {MW} wind farm has proved itself feasible and reliable in reducing the number of start-stop times, extending the unit life while meeting the load requirements. \& 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The induction generators which are utilized in wind turbines and wind farms consume high amount of reactive power. Beside, since there is no voltage regulation installed for induction machines and they draw reactive power from power system, these machines are source of voltage fluctuations. Therefore, reactive power compensation is needed to provide expected voltage support where the wind turbines are connected. Minimizing the cost of compensation is the next important step. In this paper a practical method is proposed to find the minimum cost of reactive power compensation for use in radial connection of wind power turbines to power systems.},

At high penetration levels, volatility of wind power production could cause problems for power system to maintain system security and reliability. One of the solutions being proposed to improve reliability and performance of the system is to integrate energy storage devices into the network. In this paper, unit commitment and dispatch schedule in power system with and without energy storage is examined for different level of wind penetration. Battery energy storage ({BES}) is considered as an alternative solution to store energy. The {SCUC} formulation and solution technique with wind power and {BES} is presented. The proposed formulation and model is validated with eight-bus system case study. Further, a discussion on the role of {BES} on locational pricing, economic, peak load shaving, and transmission congestion management had been made.},

	abstract = {There is a growing interest in the use of renewable energy sources to power wireless networks in order to mitigate the detrimental effects of conventional energy production or to enable deployment in off-grid locations. However, renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, are by nature unstable in their availability and capacity. The dynamics of energy supply hence impose new challenges for network planning and resource management. In this paper, the sustainable performance of a wireless mesh network powered by renewable energy sources is studied. To address the intermittently available capacity of the energy supply, adaptive resource management and admission control schemes are proposed. Speciﬁcally, the goal is to maximize the energy sustainability of the network, or equivalently, to minimize the failure probability that the mesh access points ({APs}) deplete their energy and go out of service due to the unreliable energy supply. To this end, the energy buffer of a mesh {AP} is modeled as a G/G/1(/N ) queue with arbitrary patterns of energy charging and discharging. Diffusion approximation is applied to analyze the transient evolution of the queue length and the energy depletion duration. Based on the analysis, an adaptive resource management scheme is proposed to balance trafﬁc loads across the mesh network according to the energy adequacy at different mesh {APs}. A distributed admission control strategy to guarantee high resource utilization and to improve energy sustainability is presented. By considering the ﬁrst and second order statistics of the energy charging and discharging processes at each mesh {AP}, it is demonstrated that the proposed schemes outperform some existing state-of-the-art solutions.},

Power loss, however, is a signiﬁcant problem in power exchange among the micro-grids and between the macro-station and individual micro-grids. To optimally reduce the total power losses in such a power grid system, in this paper, a greedy coalition formation algorithm is proposed, which allows the macro-station to coordinate mutual power exchange among the micro-grids and between each micro-grid and the macro-station. Our algorithm optimizes the total power losses across the entire power grid, including the cost of charging and discharging power storage devices and power losses due to power transfers. The algorithm creates exchange pairs among the micro-grids, giving priority to pairs with higher power loss reduction per exchanged power unit. Through computer-based simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed approach signiﬁcantly reduces the average power loss compared with the conventional noncooperative method. The simulations also demonstrate that the communications overhead of our proposal (due to negotiations aimed at forming coalitions) does not signiﬁcantly affect the available communication resource.},

	abstract = {One of the most important challenges in smart grid systems is the integration of renewable energy resources into its design. In this paper, two different techniques to mitigate the timevarying and intermittent nature of renewable energy generation are considered. The ﬁrst one is the use of storage, which smooths out the ﬂuctuations in the renewable energy generation across time. The second technique is the concept of distributed generation combined with cooperation by exchanging energy among the distributed sources. This technique averages out the variation in energy production across space. This paper analyzes the tradeoff between these two techniques. The problem is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the time average cost of energy exchange within the grid. First, an analytical model of the optimal cost is provided by investigating the steady state of the system for some speciﬁc scenarios. Then, an algorithm to solve the cost minimization problem using the technique of Lyapunov optimization is developed, and results for the performance of the algorithm are provided. These results show that in the presence of limited storage devices, the grid can beneﬁt greatly from cooperation, whereas in the presence of large storage capacity, cooperation does not yield much beneﬁt. Further, it is observed that most of the gains from cooperation can be obtained by exchanging energy only among a few energy-harvesting sources.},

	abstract = {Computational Fluid Dynamics ({CFD}) uses numerical methods to solve problems involving fluid flows, e.g. in automotive engineering, energy, civil engineering, and aerospace. One of these methods is the lattice Boltzmann method ({LBM}). Beside giving accurate results for a wide range of complex flows, the {LBM} lends itself to efficient implementations on massively parallel systems such as the general-purpose computing on graphics processing units ({GPGPU}). This work considers the cumulant {LBM}, which overcomes some problems of classical {LBMs}, such as the violation of the Galilean invariance, the spurious coupling of the degrees of freedoms, and the hyper-viscosity. In order to enable the cumulant {LBM} for complex {CFD} engineering problems, this work focuses on the discretization of the computational domain and the analysis of turbulent flows in the near-wall region.
The grid generation for {LBM} deals with several issues such as the second order boundary definition, the free shape grid refinement, and the level wise load balancing for parallel meshes. While discretizing complex geometries, these issues have to be handled simultaneously.
Turbulent flows close to walls are characterized by high velocity gradients in a thin region called the boundary layer. In order to resolve numerically the boundary layer, a grid with a high resolution is required resulting in a high computational cost for the simulation. Empirical functions can be used for modelling the boundary layer, allowing to estimate the quantities at the wall even with coarse grids, and thus increasing the efficiency of the numerical simulation.
In this work, a new grid generator that addresses the {LBM} discretization issues is implemented. It creates free shape multi-level three-dimensional meshes with second order accurate boundary definition for very complex geometries. It can be applied for generating grids of complex bodies, such as cars, porous media, and urban areas.
Regarding the near-wall region treatment, a new wall function is introduced. It uses local information at the boundary nodes for recovering the quantities at the wall. For generating a proper turbulence for wall bounded flows, a new set of relaxation parameters is introduced, which eliminates the spurious dependence of the error on the bulk viscosity.
In conclusion, this work addresses two important aspects for enabling the cumulant {LBM} for complex fluid flow problems: grid generation and boundary treatment for turbulent flows.},

	abstract = {Currently, Offshore Wind Farms ({OWFs}) are designed to achieve high turbine density so as to reduce costs. However, due to wake interferences, densely packing turbines reduces energy production. Having insight into optimized trade-offs between energy production, capital investment and operational costs would be valuable to {OWFs} designers. To obtain this insight, the design of {OWFs} should be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. How to best solve a Multi-Objective Wind Farm Layout Optimization Problem ({MOWFLOP}) is however still largely an open question. It is however known that evolutionary algorithms ({EAs}) are among the state-of-the-art for solving multi-objective optimization problems. This work studies the different features that an {MO} Evolutionary Algorithm ({MOEA}) should have and which Constraint-Handling Techniques ({CHTs}) are suitable for solving {MOWFLOP}. We also investigate the relation between problem dimensionality/complexity and the degrees of freedom offered by different turbine-placement grid resolutions. Finally, the inﬂuence of problem size on algorithm performance is studied. The performance of two variants of the recently introduced Multi-Objective Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm ({MOGOMEA}) is compared with a traditional and a novel version of the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm {II} ({NSGA}-{II}). Five {CHTs} were used to assess which technique provides the best results. Results on a case study with different {OWF} areas demonstrate that one variant of {MOGOMEA} outperforms the {NSGA}-{II} for all tested problem sizes and {CHTs}.},

The approach presented in this paper was applied to optimize the electrical inter-array cable systems for wind farms which is compatible with both radial and branched design philosophies, and can optimize for total cable length or cable cost. The newness of the proposed approach is based on a combination of classical and met-heuristic algorithms that use graph theory for wind farm cable route optimization.

	abstract = {Setting of turbines in a windfarm is a complex task as several factors need to be taken into consideration. During recent years, researchers have applied various evolutionary algorithms to windfarm layout problem by converting it to a single objective and at the most two objective optimization problem. The prime factor governing placement of turbines is the wake effect attributed to the loss of kinetic energy by wind after it passes over a turbine. Downstream turbine inside the wake region generates less output power. Optimizing the wake loss helps extract more power out of the wind. The cost of turbine is tactically entwined with generated output to form single objective of cost per unit of output power e.g. cost/{kW}. This paper proposes an application of L-{SHADE} algorithm, an advanced form of Differential Evolution ({DE}) algorithm, to minimize the objective cost/{kW}. {SHADE} is a success history based parameter adaptation technique of {DE}. {LSHADE} improves the performance of {SHADE} with linearly reducing the population size in successive generations. {DE} has historically been used mainly for optimization of continuous variables. The present study suggests an approach of using algorithm L-{SHADE} in discrete location optimization problem. Case studies of varying wind directions with constant and variable wind speeds have been performed and results are compared with some of the previous studies.},

Nowadays, the numbers and scale of onshore wind farms are increasing. For onshore wind farms whose the layout of wind turbines ({WT}) have been identified, optimizing cable connection can further reduce the investment cost. The cable connection layout and the substation location are determined together. Final cable connection should take the substation location into account to reduce the cable costs which occupy a large proportion in wind farm construction cost. The construction site of onshore wind farm is often not on the flat ground. To get more reasonable results, a method to get the final cable connection which optimized by minimum spanning tree is proposed in this paper under the consideration of the topographic conditions. At the same time, the position of the substation is also determined. The final results show that the cable connection obtained by this method is more economical.},

It is estimated that the expenses for electrical infrastructures account for 15-30\% of the overall initial costs, hence it is important to optimize their design. This paper focuses on oﬀshore inter-array cable routing optimization. The routing should connect all turbines to one (or more) oﬀshore substation(s) while respecting cable capacities, no-cross restrictions, connection-limits at the substation, and obstacles at the site. The objective is to minimize both the capital that must be spent immediately in cable and installation costs, and the future reduced revenues due to power losses. We present a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming approach to optimize the routing using both exact and math-heuristic methods. In the power losses computation, wind scenarios are handled eﬃciently as part of the preprocessing, resulting in a model of only slightly larger size. A library of real-life instances is introduced and made publicly available for benchmarking. Computational results on this testbed show the viability of our methods, proving that savings in the order of millions of Euro can be achieved.},

	abstract = {The growth of electrical demand increases the need of renewable energy sources, such as wind energy, to meet that need. Electrical power losses are an important factor when wind farm location and size are selected. The capitalized cost of constant power losses during the life of a wind farm will continue to high levels. During the operation period, a method to determine if the losses meet the requirements of the design is signiﬁcantly needed. This article presents a Simulink simulation of wind farm integration into the grid; the aim is to achieve a better understanding of wind variation impact on grid losses. The real power losses are set as a function of the annual variation, considering a Weibull distribution. An analytical method has been used to select the size and placement of a wind farm, taking into account active power loss reduction. It proposes a fast linear model estimation to ﬁnd the optimal capacity of a wind farm based on {DC} power ﬂow and graph theory. The results show that the analytical approach is capable of predicting the optimal size and location of wind turbines. Furthermore, it revealed that the annual variation of wind speed could have a strong effect on real power loss calculations. In addition to helping to improve utility efﬁciency, the proposed method can develop speciﬁc designs to speeding up integration of wind farms into grids.},

	abstract = {Installation layout of wind turbines plays a prominent role in the design of every wind farm. Thus, the wind farm layout optimization problem is proposed to maximize the total power output with the minimum cost. In this research, Kahrizak region in Tehran province of Iran is selected as a windy region and its real wind speed data are gleaned. Three different scenarios are also considered, with various number of generations and populations for {GA} parameters, effective distances, and longitude and latitude distances of turbines from each other. Among these scenarios, the best result is obtained for the one in which the longitudinal distance between turbines is greater than the latitudinal distance. By observing the wind rose of Kahrizak region, it is observed that the dominant wind direction of the region is toward the east and south–east. Therefore, by increasing the longitudinal distance of the turbines from each other, the efficiency can be improved and the turbine layout becomes more realistic. In this case, the efficiency rate and normalized cost of turbines are 89.5\% and 37.4, respectively, and also 56 turbines are needed. The amounts of efficiency and power output are very convenient for real wind speed data of a region.},

The model is linked to {NSGA} {II}, {NSGA} {III}, and {SPEA} 2 algorithms, to conduct an optimisation search. The performance of these three algorithms is demonstrated and analysed, so as to assess their effectiveness in the investment decision-making process in the wind sector, more importantly, for Round 3 zones.

Measurements show enhanced wake effects in the {SABL} compared to the unstable situation. Another inﬂuence on the power generation of an offshore wind farm is the distance of the wind farm to the shore. This is accounted for in the {LES} by a modiﬁcation of surface characteristics at the coastal discontinuity. In addition to the effect of the coast, the numerical case study also shows the existence of local jets between the turbines of the wind farm.},

The effect of the modeling approach, discretization scheme and turbulence model on mean velocities, turbulent kinetic energy and global quantities, such as the power and circulation numbers, has been investigated. The results have been validated by {LDV} data. The stationary and time-dependent modeling approaches were found to have little effect on the turbulent flow, however the choice of the numerical scheme was found to be important, especially for the predicted turbulent kinetic energy. A first order method was found to highly underestimate {LDV} data compared with higher order methods. The type of the turbulence model was limited to the k-ε and {RNG} models due to convergence difficulties encountered with a Reynolds Stress Model ({RSM}) and there was found to be little effect of these models on the mean flow and turbulent kinetic energy. This latter quantity was found to be largely under predicted in the discharge region of the down-pumping impeller in comparison with {LDV} data. Better agreement was found for the up-pumping pitched blade turbine. Estimated power numbers were found generally to be in good agreement for the down- and up-pumping data. However, the circulation number tended to be over predicted by about 30\% and 40\% for the down- and uppumping agitators, respectively.},

One of the main challenges in optimizing the design, operation, control, and grid integration of wind farms is the prediction of their performance, owing to the complex multiscale two-way interactions between wind farms and the turbulent atmospheric boundary layer ({ABL}). From a fluid mechanical perspective, these interactions are complicated by the high Reynolds number of the {ABL} flow, its inherent unsteadiness due to the diurnal cycle and synoptic-forcing variability, the ubiquitous nature of thermal effects, and the heterogeneity of the terrain. Particularly important is the effect of {ABL} turbulence on wind-turbine wake flows and their superposition, as they are responsible for considerable turbine power losses and fatigue loads in wind farms. These flow interactions affect, in turn, the structure of the {ABL} and the turbulent fluxes of momentum and scalars. This review summarizes recent experimental, computational, and theoretical research efforts that have contributed to improving our understanding and ability to predict the interactions of {ABL} flow with wind turbines and wind farms.},

We model the long-term variability of wind speed using a Weibull distribution according to wind direction intervals, and formulate the metrics that capture wind speed characteristics at a speciﬁc location, namely the arithmetic mean of wind speed, the theoretical wind power density and the capacity factor of a prospective wind power plant, to determine the feasibility of a wind power plant establishment. Furthermore, a linear optimization formulation is provided to determine the geographical locations and the installed capacities of wind farms, in order to maximize the expected annual wind power generation, while obeying the constraints from the electrical power grid and the transmission system operator. As a case study, the proposed wind speed model and the linear optimization formulation are used to evaluate the wind characteristics and the potential wind farm sites in Turkey.},

	abstract = {The Ball-Pivoting Algorithm ({BPA}) computes a triangle mesh interpolating a given point cloud. Typically the points are surface samples acquired with multiple range scans of an object. The principle of the {BPA} is very simple: Three points form a triangle if a ball of a user-speciﬁed radius touches them without containing any other point. Starting with a seed triangle, the ball pivots around an edge (i.e. it revolves around the edge while keeping in contact with the edge’s endpoints) until it touches another point, forming another triangle. The process continues until all reachable edges have been tried, and then starts from another seed triangle, until all points have been considered. We applied the {BPA} to datasets of millions of points representing actual scans of complex 3D objects. The relatively small amount of memory required by the {BPA}, its time efﬁciency, and the quality of the results obtained compare favorably with existing techniques.},

Consideration is first given to the meshing requirements associated with the transient solution of turbulent flow problems discretized using a stabilized finite element method. This study indicates the key importance of controlling the smoothness of mesh gradations on transient problems and demonstrates that in the presence of strongly anisotropic gradients the issue of what constitutes an unacceptably large dihedral angle does not follow the conventional thinking associated with meshes for problems with isotropic gradients. Progress on the development of mesh generation tools to provide the types of anisotropic meshes needed for these classes of problems and their application to a turbulent flow problem is also given.},

The paper covers the description of the governing equations, their numerical implementation, and the parameterizations included in the code. Furthermore, the paper presents the validation of the dynamical core in the form of convergence and conservation tests, and comparison of simulations of channel ﬂows and slope ﬂows against well-established test cases. The full numerical model, including the associated parameterizations for {LES}, has been tested for a set of cases under stable and unstable conditions, under the Boussinesq and anelastic approximations, and with dry and moist convection under stationary and time-varying boundary conditions. The paper presents performance tests showing good scaling from 256 to 32 768 processes. The graphical processing unit ({GPU})enabled version of the code can reach a speedup of more than an order of magnitude for simulations that ﬁt in the memory of a single {GPU}.},

In this paper we describe a pure scientiﬁc Python pseudo-spectral {DNS} code that nearly matches the performance of C++ for thousands of processors and billions of unknowns. We also describe a version optimized through Cython, that is found to match the speed of C++. The solvers are written from scratch in Python, both the mesh, the {MPI} domain decomposition, and the temporal integrators. The solvers have been veriﬁed and benchmarked on the Shaheen supercomputer at the {KAUST} supercomputing laboratory, and we are able to show very good scaling up to several thousand cores.},

Turbine wake simulations were performed on {NREL} unsteady aerodynamics experiment phase {VI} two-bladed wind turbines. The Lattice Boltzmann Method ({LBM}) was used to model the wakes behind turbines. The ability of {LBM} to capture wake evolution and detailed flow characteristics were explored for a single and three in-line turbines.

It is characterized by two basic parameters: the roughness length z0 and the displacement height d. Estimation of these parameters over a large area through full scale tests is typically not feasible. Alternatively, wind tunnel tests could be employed, but they can be costly. Often empirical methods are used for estimating roughness.

	abstract = {Roughness determines many functional properties of surfaces, such as adhesion, friction, and (thermal and electrical) contact conductance. Recent analytical models and simulations enable quantitative prediction of these properties from knowledge of the power spectral density ({PSD}) of the surface topography. The utility of the {PSD} is that it contains statistical information that is unbiased by the particular scan size and pixel resolution chosen by the researcher. In this article, we first review the mathematical definition of the {PSD}, including the one- and two-dimensional cases, and common variations of each. We then discuss strategies for reconstructing an accurate {PSD} of a surface using topography measurements at different size scales. Finally, we discuss detecting and mitigating artifacts at the smallest scales, and computing upper/lower bounds on functional properties obtained from models. We accompany our discussion with virtual measurements on computer-generated surfaces. This discussion summarizes how to analyze topography measurements to reconstruct a reliable {PSD}. Analytical models demonstrate the potential for tuning functional properties by rationally tailoring surface topography – however, this potential can only be achieved through the accurate, quantitative reconstruction of the power spectral density of real-world surfaces.},

On the wind simulation, the highest problem would be the boundary conditions, and the case in this paper was simplified one. The case study in this paper is the west wind on a complex terrain site, which is the wind from sea for the site. The steady flow was employed for the inlet condition, because the wind on the sea is the low turbulent wind, and almost all the turbulence would be generated by the roughness of the ground surface. The wall function was employed as the surface condition on the ground surface. The computational domain size was about 8 × 3 × 2.5 km3, and the minimum cell size was about 10 × 10 × 3 m3. The computational results, the vertical profile of the averaged wind speed and the turbulence intensity, agreed with the measurement by the meteorological masts. Moreover, the authors tried the analysis of the turbulence characteristics. The power spectrum density model, and the cross spectrum analyses gave the knowledge of the turbulent characteristics on the complex terrain and the hints for the domain and grid of the numerical analysis.},

However, as wind power development expands into areas of even more complex terrain and challenging ﬂow conditions, more research is needed to investigate the ability of such models to describe turbulent ﬂow features. In this study, the performance of a hybrid Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes ({RANS})/Large Eddy Simulation ({LES}) model in highly complex terrain has been investigated. The model was compared with measurements from a long range pulsed Lidar, which ﬁrst were validated with sonic anemometer data. The accuracy of the Lidar was considered to be sufﬁcient for validation of ﬂow model turbulence estimates. By reducing the range gate length of the Lidar a slight additional improvement in accuracy was obtained, but the availability of measurements was reduced due to the increased noise ﬂoor in the returned signal. The {DES} model was able to capture the variations of velocity and turbulence along the line-of-sight of the Lidar beam but overestimated the turbulence level in regions of complex ﬂow.},

The {CFD} model is also compared to the {WAsP} linear model of wind flow over topography, and a significant improvement is noted for flow over complex topography. Boundary conditions, gridding issues and sensitivity to other solver parameters have all been investigated. An advanced roughness model has been developed to simulate flow over forest canopies, using a resistive body force within the canopy volume. The model is validated against measured data for simple 2D cases, and for a complex 3D case over real topography. The model is shown to give a more physically realistic profile for the wind speed in and just above forest canopies than the standard roughness length model used in most {CFD} simulations. An automated methodology for setting up {CFD} simulations using the models described has been developed. A custom pre-processing package to implement this has been written, to enable the use of the {CFD} methodology in a commercial environment.},

	abstract = {Las válvulas mariposa son componentes muy utilizados para el transporte de fluidos a
través de tuberías. Dentro de estas válvulas, destacan las válvulas mariposas de doble
excentricidad por tener ciertas ventajas como por ejemplo la reducción del desgaste de
su sellado en comparación con las válvulas mariposas clásicas. Sin embargo, su asimetría origina un comportamiento más crítico en cuanto a las características hidráulicas del flujo, como son: la pérdida de carga, la distorsión del perfil de velocidades y el riesgo a la cavitación. Como es usual utilizar estas válvulas para control on-off de flujos, se desean bajas pérdidas de carga en su posición totalmente abierta. Cuando estas válvulas se sitúan directamente en el ingreso de turbomáquinas, es importante conocer el grado de distorsión del perfil de velocidades que entra en la máquina ya que ésto modifica los ángulos de ataque del flujo con los álabes y con ello
el punto de operación. Y si se opera con presiones bajas también se debe considerar
el riesgo de cavitación en partes de la válvula donde se eleve localmente la velocidad.
Son estas tres características las que se estudiarán en una válvula mariposa previamente diseñada en la {PUCP}, con el fin de mejorar la geometría original y con
ello su comportamiento hidráulico. Idealmente, se deben realizar ensayos experimentales para conocer el comportamiento hidráulico, pero estos métodos generalmente resultan muy costosos. Una alternativa utilizada hoy en día para la optimización de productos es el estudio computacional {CFD} (Computational Fluid Dynamics) el cual tiene ciertas ventajas, ya que entrega la información de todos los puntos del dominio y permite realizar cambios en la geometría o en el flujo de forma rápida y menos costosa.
En el presente trabajo se realiza el análisis {CFD} de una válvula mariposa de doble excentricidad con un diámetro nominal de 610mm, en posición completamente abierta con un caudal aproximado de agua de 1 m3/s a 10{ºC} lo que implica una velocidad media en la tubería de aproximadamente 3.5 m/s. Para ello se utilizó el programa {ANSYS} {CFX} 14.0 y se empleó el modelo de turbulencia {SST}. Luego, se realizó una modificación del diseño original para obtener un diseño alternativo el cual es incluso un
2\% más ligero. Lo más importante fue que se consiguió una reducción del 38.3\% del
coeficiente de pérdidas del diseño original y se aumentó un 40.4\% la resistencia a la
cavitación del diseño original. Sin embargo, al igual que en el diseño original, el flujo
recién comienza a recuperar la forma que tenía antes de ingresar a la válvula después
de 14 diámetros nominales aguas abajo de la misma.},

This study aims to evaluate the capability of a lattice-Boltzmann method ({LBM}) code deployed on a graphical processing unit ({GPU}) using a large eddy sub-grid turbulence model for cross-ﬂow ventilation of an idealised cubical building at wind-tunnel scale. {ANSYS} Fluent is used as a numerical comparison. Façade pressure and ventilation of the cube are investigated for parallel and perpendicular wind directions with the building in isolation and regular array format. Pressures, velocities and ventilation rates are compared to experimental data from wind tunnel and full-scale experiments of the Silsoe cube. Simulations compare favourably with experimental values and between each other. When the cube was surrounded by other cubes, simulations suggest that vortex shedding from up-wind buildings provides pulsating ventilation, improving airﬂow ingress in the parallel wind cases. A parametric study showed that doubling surrounding building height had a small negative effect on ventilation but was mitigated by high levels of downdraft and ﬂow ﬂuctuations in the vertical plane. Comparatively, doubling the central building height had a net positive effect but caused high internal airspeeds for both angles. The {LBM} code running on one {GPU} was several orders of magnitude faster than Fluent with similar accuracy. Simulation time using the {LBM} approach was several orders of magnitude lower than Fluent.},

The ﬂow of ﬂuids in a pipe network is an important and widely studied problem in any engineering industry. It is always signiﬁcant to see the development of a ﬂuid ﬂow and pressure drop in a pipe at higher Reynolds number. A ﬁnite volume method ({FVM}) solver with keε turbulence model and enhanced wall treatment is used ﬁrst time to investigate the ﬂow of water at different velocities with higher Reynolds number in a 3D pipe. Numerical results have been presented to illustrate the effects of Reynolds number on turbulence intensity, average shear stress and friction factor. Friction factor is used to investigate the pressure drop along the length of the pipe. The contours of wall function are also presented to investigate the effect of enhanced wall treatment on a ﬂuid ﬂow. A maximum Reynolds number is also found for which the selected pipe length is sufﬁcient to ﬁnd a full developed turbulent ﬂow at outlet. The results of {CFD} modeling are validated by comparing them with available data in literature. The model results have been shown good agreement with experimental and corelation data.},

	abstract = {Accurate prediction of atmospheric boundary layer ({ABL}) ﬂow and its interactions with wind turbines is of great importance for optimizing the design (turbine siting) of wind energy projects. Large-eddy simulation ({LES}) can potentially provide the kind of high-resolution spatial and temporal information needed to maximize wind energy production and minimize fatigue loads in wind farms. However, the accuracy of {LES} in simulations of {ABL} ﬂow with wind turbines hinges on our ability to parameterize subgrid-scale ({SGS}) turbulent ﬂuxes as well as turbine-induced forces. This paper focuses on recent efforts to develop and validate a {LES} framework for wind energy applications. Both {SGS} stress and {SGS} heat ﬂux are parameterized using tuning-free scaledependent Lagrangian dynamic models (Stoll and Porte´-Agel, 2006a). These models optimize the local value of the model coefﬁcients based on the dynamics of the resolved scales. The turbineinduced lift and drag forces are parameterized using two types of models: an actuator disk model ({ADM}) that distributes the force loading on the rotor disk, and an actuator line model ({ALM}) that distributes the forces on lines that follow the position of the blades. Simulation results are compared to wind-tunnel measurements collected with hot-wire and cold-wire anemometry in the wake of a miniature 3-blade wind turbine at the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory {ABL} wind tunnel. In general, the characteristics of the turbine wakes simulated with the proposed {LES} framework are in good agreement with the measurements. Finally, results are presented from simulations performed with the new {LES} framework to study the effects of wind farms on local and regional-scale turbulent ﬂuxes of momentum and heat.},

The influence of distances between these devices on the formation of the {ABL} is established, and optimization of variation of thicknesses of the screens (thin, medium, and coarse) on pressure loss is explored. The results obtained in this work gave support for the analysis of the atmospheric flow and turbulence at Alcantara Launching Center ({ALC}) in order to launch Brazilian space vehicles under safe conditions. The results show that the “spires” and the thin screen are the devices that require the least area to form an {ABL} in a test chamber. The physical proximity of two devices (the spires and the medium screen) also influences the size of the {ABL} formed, which varies from 180 to 200 mm. The power law exponent ranged from 0.12 up to 0.14 after the insertion of a carpet.},

The physical solutions are obtained by appropriate mixing of the waked- and freestream velocity deﬁcit solutions, reﬂecting the fact that only a portion of the ﬂuid particles passing through the rotor disk will interact with a blade.},

	abstract = {We present a methodology to process wind turbine wake simulations, which are closely related to the nature of wake observations and the processing of these to generate the so-called wake cases. The method involves averaging a large number of wake simulations over a range of wind directions and partly accounts for the uncertainty in the wind direction assuming that the same follows a Gaussian distribution. Simulations of the single and double wake measurements at the Sexbierum onshore wind farm are performed using a fast engineering wind farm wake model based on the Jensen wake model, a linearized computational ﬂuid dynamics wake model by Fuga and a nonlinear computational ﬂuid dynamics wake model that solves the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations with a modiﬁed k-" turbulence model. The best agreement between models and measurements is found using the Jensen-based wake model with the suggested post-processing. We show that the wake decay coefﬁcient of the Jensen wake model must be decreased from the commonly used onshore value of 0.075 to 0.038, when applied to the Sexbierum cases, as wake decay is related to the height, roughness and atmospheric stability and, thus, to turbulence intensity. Based on surface layer relations and assumptions between turbulence intensity and atmospheric stability, we ﬁnd that at Sexbierum, the atmosphere was probably close to stable, although the stability was not observed. We support these assumptions using detailed meteorological observations from the Høvsøre site in Denmark, which is topographically similar to the Sexbierum region. © 2015 The Authors.

For this reason, a wind-tunnel investigation was carried out on the variations in mean velocity, Reynolds shear-stress, and other turbulence quantities in a deep turbulent flow over a rough surface having a fair degree of randomness in the shapes, sizes, and positions of its elements.There was a layer close to the surface with considerable variations in both mean velocity and shear-stress, and the horizontal scale over which the mean velocity varied was much larger than the average distance between roughness elements. Above this layer, whose depth was of the order of the spacing between roughness elements, shear stress was constant with height, and the velocity profile had a logarithmic form. The usefulness of both mean profile and eddy-correlation methods for estimating fluxes above very rough terrain is discussed in the light of these findings.},

The wind speeds at 34 m and 20 m above ground level, wind direction, atmospheric pressure, and temperature were measured for more than five years and were statistically analyzed. The daily, monthly, yearly, and seasonal averages were estimated. For the site, the overall average wind speed at 34 m above ground level is found to be 5.18 m/s. The occurrence of effective wind (between the cut-in and cut-off wind speeds of the selected turbine) is predominantly from the east. An effective wind speed of 74.175\% was recorded which can be used for power generation. The turbulence intensity and wind shear coefficient are estimated. The site’s overall turbulence intensities are 12.5\% and 13.72\% at 34 m and 20 m above ground level, respectively. The diurnal wind shear correlated with the temperature variation very well. The overall and seasonal wind distributions are analyzed, which shows that the wind speed in Suva is mostly between 3 m/s and 9 m/s although the winter season has higher wind speeds. The Weibull parameters and the wind power density were found using 10 different methods. The wind power density is estimated to be 159 W/m2 using the best method, which is found to be the empirical method of Justus. A highresolution map around the site is digitized and the wind power density resource map is generated using wind atlas analysis and application program. From the wind atlas analysis and application program analysis, it is seen that Suva has high potential for power generation. Five possible locations are selected for installing wind turbines and the annual energy production is estimated using wind atlas analysis and application program. The total annual energy production from the five sites is 1950 {MWh}. The average capacity factor of the five turbines is 17\%. An economic analysis is performed which showed a payback period of 10.83 years.},

	abstract = {The presenting paper investigates on the validation of the turbulence intensity ({TI}) modeled by a {CFD} tool. Six meteorological masts, equipped with cup anemometers, have been used for the purpose. Three different turbulence closure schemes, which are the {SST} k-omega and the k-epsilon in two different conﬁgurations, have been tested. The ﬂow analysis shows a qualitative agreement between measurements and models, which are capable to simulate the turning of the wind towards South when it comes from {SSE}. Furthermore, the simulations predict a zone of high turbulence in the northern part of the site that is conﬁrmed by the local measurements. The scores for {TI} have been quantiﬁed by considering the observed directional frequencies in the validation analysis. For the testing site, the {SST} k-omega scheme achieves the best performance when using the {TI} deﬁnition which is representative of the longitudinal ﬂuctuations of the velocity vector, against the other one, which considers the ﬂuctuation of the horizontal vector. Lastly, the model errors have been used to correct the simulated values using two approaches; the analysis shows that, for the presented case, these correction methods do not always improve the accuracy of the simulations.},

The numerical results were validated against a experimental results from a laboratory impinging jet simulator operating at the same scale. Having found the {CFD} simulation to match well with the laboratory scale the {CFD} was then used to visualise and interpret the ﬂow ﬁeld around the buildings. Common transient atmospheric boundary layer ﬂow features, such as conical vortices, vortices on the rear face of a building, ﬂow separation and vortex shedding were observed and could be used to explain the lift and drag results obtained. In particular, motion of the primary vortex from the downburst and its effect on the transient pressures on the building were identiﬁed, with strong pressure gradients observed for a number of conﬁgurations. Aspects of the ﬂow phenomena were identiﬁed, which along with the strong pressure changes on the building surfaces, indicate areas of further research due to their potential impact on building and cladding design.},

The spatial mapping of the calculated quantities allows the identiﬁcation of two regions, which is in agreement with the topography of the Swiss territory.

	abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) ﬂow inside a lid driven cavity ({LDC}) is shown to display multi-modal behavior in a consistent manner following the ﬁrst Hopf bifurcation with varying Reynolds numbers (Re), depending upon the chosen spatial and temporal discretization scheme. Direct numerical simulation ({DNS}) following impulsive start, is used to show spatio-temporal growth and its nonlinear saturation of disturbance growth. Despite the fact that researchers have produced different value of Reynolds number when ﬁrst Hopf bifurcation occurs (Recr1), {DNS} fundamentally differs from classical bifurcation studies involving global instability study of an equilibrium ﬂow due to adopted nonlinear approach and not restricting the analysis to temporal instability only. The accuracy attribute of the {DNS} adopted here has been shown conclusively earlier via demonstration of a weak transient polygonal core vortex surrounded by relatively stronger gyrating vortices, which appear as a constellation after the disappearance of the transient, in [26]. Investigated {LDC} ﬂow is characterized by multiple time scales at any Re, which are weak function of Re in selective intervals, punctuated by multiple bifurcations. The present investigation achieves two primary goals. First, it proposes to reconcile that Recr1 obtained by different numerical approaches can be shown to be in same range, provided the equilibrium ﬂow obtained is of good quality, untainted by excessive diffusion. Secondly, we also show that for increasing Re following the ﬁrst Hopf bifurcation, the ﬂow during the limit cycle suffers a secondary instability, thus, requiring computation of the ﬂow ﬁeld over a longer time period. The ﬁrst goal is met by exciting the ﬂow ﬁeld with a pulsating vortex inside the {LDC} for a very high accuracy scheme, we are able to show the universal nature of the primary bifurcation for Re in the range between 8020 and 8025. The ﬂow at higher Re displays signiﬁcantly increased spectral peaks, including broad-band spectrum and the understanding of all these have been aided by phase space portraits.},

Simulations for Reynolds number (Re) values up to 5000 are abundant and consistent; however at larger Re values there is no agreement whether steady ﬂow simulations are computable or not. Some studies state that driven cavity ﬂow at higher Re values undergo a supercritical Hopf bifurcation leading to an unsteady ﬂow state. Other studies tend to disagree, providing steady ﬂow computations up to a maximum Re value of 21,000. In the present study, we adopt a stream function–vorticity formulation and a compact fourth-order-accurate central difference scheme to show that steady ﬂow simulations are, in fact, computable up to Re = 35,000. It is shown that for Re = 35,000, the steady ﬂow inside the cavity is comprised of thin boundary layers along the cavity walls and a core ﬂow which resembles an inviscid rotational vortex with uniform vorticity. Present numerical results agree well with previous analytical solutions in the limit of inﬁnite Reynolds number. Tabulated results for the properties of the primary vortex and the velocity components are also provided spanning the entire range from the creeping ﬂow limit, Re = 0 up to Re = 35,000 for benchmarking purposes.},

As a possibility to create reference {DNS} solutions for more complex geometries, we have assessed the (quasi-){DNS} capabilities of the {OpenFOAM} ﬁnite volume {CFD} solver for both structured hexahedral meshes and arbitrary polyhedral meshes. The feasibility of (quasi-){DNS} analyses on polyhedral grids is of main interest, since this may offer the possibility to significantly expand the availability of (quasi-){DNS}-quality data on arbitrarily complex geometries. In order to have a basis for the considered assessment, the mutual differences between generally recognized reference {DNS} data bases for turbulent channel and pipe ﬂows are determined ﬁrst. Subsequently, the differences between these reference {DNS} solutions and the present {OpenFOAM} (quasi-){DNS} solutions are quantiﬁed for the considered mesh types. We use an existing ﬁnite volume {CFD} method and well known turbulent channel and pipe ﬂow {DNS} reference cases for the assessments in this paper. New in this paper are the application of this {CFD} method to (quasi-){DNS} analyses using arbitrary polyhedral meshes, and the quantiﬁcation of respectively the mutual differences between generally recognized reference {DNS} data bases and the differences between the obtained {OpenFOAM} (quasi-){DNS} data and these reference {DNS} data bases.},

This is when a stationary solution loses stability and often becomes periodic in time. The difﬁculty is to determine the critical Reynolds number where a pair of eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix crosses the imaginary axis. This requires the computation of the eigenvalues (or at least some of them) of a large matrix resulting from the discretization of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. We thus present a method allowing the computation of the smallest eigenvalues, from which we can extract the one with the smallest real part. From the imaginary part of the critical eigenvalue we can deduce the fundamental frequency of the time-periodic solution. \#These computations are then conﬁrmed by direct simulation of the time-dependent Navier–Stokes equations. 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The impact of three different surface roughness lengths on the turbine performance is studied for the both turbines. The turbines performance, the response to the variation in the surface roughness of terrain, and the most relevant phenomena involved on the resulting wake were investigated. The main goal was to evaluate the differences and similarities of these two different types of turbine when they operate under the same atmospheric flow conditions. An actuator line model ({ALM}) was used together with the large eddy simulation ({LES}) approach for predicting wake effects, and it was implemented using the open-source computational fluid dynamics ({CFD}) library {OpenFOAM} to solve the governing equations and to compute the resulting flow fields. This model was first validated using wind tunnel measurements of power coefficients and wake of interacting {HAWTs}, and then employed to study the wake structure of both full scale turbines. A preliminary study test comparing the forces on a {VAWT} blades against measurements was also investigated. These obtained results showed a better performance and shorter wake (faster recovery) for an {HAWT} compared with a {VAWT} for the same atmospheric conditions.},

After a short review of the basic model and extensions, we compare the accuracy and computational eﬃciency of two research simulation codes based on the {LB} and the ﬁnite-element method ({FEM}) for two-dimensional incompressible laminar ﬂow problems with complex geometries. We also study the inﬂuence of the Mach number on the solution, since {LB} methods are weakly compressible by nature, by comparing compressible and incompressible results obtained from the {LB} code and the commercial code {CFX}. Our results indicate, that for the quantities studied (lift, drag, pressure drop) our {LB} prototype is competitive for incompressible transient problems, but asymptotically slower for steady-state Stokes ﬂow because the asymptotic algorithmic complexity of the classical {LB}-method is not optimal compared to the multigrid solvers incorporated in the {FEM} and {CFX} code. For the weakly compressible case, the {LB} approach has a signiﬁcant wall clock time advantage as compared to {CFX}. In addition, we demonstrate that the inﬂuence of the ﬁnite Mach number in {LB} simulations of incompressible ﬂow is easily underestimated.},

Numerical simulations are reported up to a maximum Reynolds number, Re, value of 15000 for deep cavities and 20000 for shallow cavities using a compact fourth-order accurate central difference scheme and a stream function–vorticity formulation. At high Reynolds numbers, the eddy structure in shallow cavities consists of counter-rotating primary eddies, with each eddy behaving as an inviscid core with uniform vorticity. For deep cavities, the increase in Reynolds number results in the growth and eventually merger of the corner eddies into new primary eddies. Two merger patterns are identified, a symmetric pattern and an asymmetric pattern depending on a local Reynolds number based on the properties of the bottom primary eddy. A cavity with effectively infinite depth, D = 10, is also numerically investigated up to a maximum Re value of 10000. Numerical results indicate that for an infinitely deep cavity and at a large Reynolds number, inertia effects would dominate near the upper moving wall, while Stokes flow behavior would dominate away from the moving wall. An overlap region would exist, in which both inertia and viscous effects are of comparable magnitude. Finally, an analytical solution is developed for the steady flow in a rectangular cavity at large Reynolds numbers. Results from the analytical model are compared to numerical solutions obtained from the full Navier–Stokes equations for both one-sided and four-sided driven cavity configurations.},

Due to their eﬃcient computational performance, analytical {WLMs}, also called kinematic models, are the most likely candidates for such applications. This paper examines the performance of six well-known analytical {WLMs}, i.e., Jensen, Larsen, Frandsen, Bastankah and Porté-Agel ({BPA}), Xie and Archer ({XA}), and Geometric Model ({GM}), by comparing their absolute error, bias, correlation coeﬃcient, and ability to predict power production within one standard deviation of the mean observed values at three major commercial wind farms: Lillgrund (oﬀshore, in Sweden), Anholt (oﬀshore, in Denmark) and Nørrekær (inland, in Denmark). The three wind farms are chosen to cover many aspects of wind farms, such as oﬀshore and inland conditions, regular and irregular layouts, and closely- to widely-spaced turbines. The conclusions of this review and the recommendations that are put forward provide practical guidelines for using analytical {WLMs} eﬀectively in future wind energy applications. Overall, the Jensen and {XA} models stand out for their consistently strong performance and for rarely (Jensen) or never ({XA}) ranking last for all wind directions at all farms and are therefore the recommended models in general.},

The spectra of the velocities in the wake of the 3-D hill and 2-D ridge, and those over the ﬂat terrain, are calculated. Spectra of velocity ﬂuctuations at selected locations in the wake of topographic features are well reproduced. The examination of spectra shades some lights on the dynamics of the turbulent ﬂow. It is found that the spectra of ﬂuids in the wake are sensitive to the oncoming turbulence condition for the 2-D ridge, which is not true for the 3-D hill. Non-isotropic characteristics of turbulence in the near-wake of topographic features are examined using ratios of Reynolds stress which are also compared with those in {IEC} 61400-1 (2005).},

An extended ﬁlter technique is introduced based on selective viscosity ﬁlters. In contrast to previous approaches we omit adjusting parameters, a technique frequently used in literature to achieve good ﬁt with turbulence benchmarks. Such parameters have to be adapted manually for diﬀerent Reynolds numbers and grid resolutions. The new ﬁlter approach is based on a time dependent coupling between resolved scales and a phase averaged strain-rate. We demonstrate that our method is able to recover turbulent statistics of the Taylor-Green vortex benchmark, representing Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence for varying mesh resolutions and Reynolds numbers. Beyond that, we show the applicability to wall-bounded turbulence represented by the turbulent channel ﬂow at friction Reynolds numbers Reτ = 180, Reτ = 395 and Reτ = 590. A spectral viscosity analysis is performed in order to demonstrate the methods ability to adapt the numerical dissipation according to the mesh resolution.},

	abstract = {Cette thèse porte sur le développement d’un modèle numérique de l’affouillement causée par des obstacles montes sur le lit, combinant les processus hydrodynamiques et morphologiques. Le modèle numérique est basé sur le solveur de champ d’écoulement polyphasique de l’outil {CFD} open-source {OpenFOAMR} qui est distribue par {OpenCFD} Ltd. Le module hydrodynamique du modèle résout les équations de Navier-Stokes avec moyennes de Reynolds ({RANS}) et les modèles des turbulences k-ε ou k-ω. Il existe deux interfaces dans le domaine de simulation: la surface libre entre l’eau et l’air, qui est suivi par la méthode de Volume de Fluide ({VOF}); et l’interface entre l’eau et le lit du sédiment, qui est représentée par un maillage de surface finie déformable construit à partir de la limite en bas du maillage de volume fini. En outre, un module morphologique qui a été développé dans le cadre du projet se compose de trois composantes: un modèle de transport de sédiments comprenant la charge suspendue et le charriage; l’équation d’Exner pour mesurer la déformation du lit; et un mécanisme de glissement du sable pour limiter la pente du lit à être plus petite que l’angle de repos du sédiment. Le changement morphologique est incorporé dans le modèle hydrodynamique par la déformation du maillage. Des conditions limites spéciales et des corrections nécessaires pour le calcul en parallèle sont également ajoutées au modèle. Chaque partie du modèle est validée séparément avec les tests préliminaires correspondants, y compris les fonctions de paroi rugueuse, les performances de la méthode {VOF}, le modèle de transport de charge suspendu et le mécanisme de glissement de sable. Le modèle numérique est ensuite appliqué pour étudier un affouillent bidimensionnelle cause par un jet immerge provenant d’une ouverture sous écluse. Comparaison des résultats de la simulation avec des données expérimentales prouve la capacité du modèle. Et les limites du modèle sont également discutées. Enfin, le modèle est appliqué à l’étude du champ d’écoulement tridimensionnel et de la formation d’affouillement autour d’un obstacle dans l’écoulement. Tout d’abord, la déformation du lit n’est pas activée. Le tourbillon en fer à cheval devant un obstacle et le champ d’écoulement turbulent autour d’un cylindre sur un lit lisse ou rugueux sont simulés. Deux types de simulation pour le module hydrodynamique sont effectués: une simulation qui utilise une surface fixe et rigide pour représenter l’interface air-eau, et une simulation incluant à la fois les domaines de l’eau et de l’air avec la surface libre suivie par la méthode {VOF}. Les influences de la surface libre sur le champ d’écoulement sont identifiées et discutées. La comparaison avec les données expérimentales confirme l’importance de la déformation de la surface libre sur le champ d’écoulement. Ensuite, le lit est autorisé à se déformer et le développement temporel de l’affouillement tridimensionnelle autour d’un cylindre sur le lit est simule. Le développement temporel d’affouillement et la profondeur maximale du trou calcule devant et derrière le cylindre conviennent assez bien avec les mesures expérimentales. Les influences de l’affouillement sur le champ d’écoulement sont aussi étudiées et la performance du modèle numérique développé est discutée.},

However, converged steady solutions cannot be achieved at higher Re (15,000–30,000) by {SIMPLE}-family algorithms owing to its inherent drawbacks. In this work, a new segregated solver, {ISTEC}-N (incompressible ﬂow solver with two explicit N correction loops), for determining the solution of incompressible ﬂow on structured collocated grid systems is proposed. A pressure equation is deduced from the discretized continuity equation to overcome the ‘‘Semi-Implicit” characteristic of the {SIMPLE} algorithm. An explicit velocity update loop is introduced to improve the consistency between the pressure ﬁeld and the velocity ﬁeld in each outer iteration. The performance of the {ISTEC}-N algorithm is evaluated by solving the driven-cavity problem at high Re number of (15,000 {\textless} Re {\textless} 30,000). It is shown that the {ISTEC}-N algorithm manifests a strong robustness feature under these high convection conditions. The computational results given by the {ISTEC}-N algorithm are in excellent agreement with the benchmarking data.},

As the integration of the model up to the ground surface is still not viable for complex terrains, a speciﬁc law of the wall including roughness eﬀects is implemented. The wake eﬀects and the aerodynamic behavior of the wind turbines are described using the actuator disk model, upon which a volumetric force is included in the momentum equations.

While the system governing averaged small-amplitude perturbations to turbulent channel ﬂow remains unknown, the fact such eigenmodes can be identiﬁed constitutes direct evidence that it is linear. Moreover, while the eigenvalue associated with the slowest-decaying anti-symmetric eigenmode mode is found to be real, the eigenvalue associated with the slowest-decaying symmetric eigenmode mode is found to be complex. This indicates that the unknown linear system governing the evolution of averaged small-amplitude perturbations cannot be self-adjoint, even for the case of a uni-directional ﬂow.

In this paper, a novel method based on on-site measurement coupled to computational fluid dynamics ({CFD}) simulations is proposed to reproduce the spatial variability of wind speed distribution over the region with complex terrain. The on-site measurement data of wind speeds are adopted in the data fusion for wind speed distribution estimation and reproduction, combined with the simulation results of {CFD}. Next, a case study on wind resource assessment for a wind farm in complex terrain, located in Hebei Province, China was done. One year wind measurements with anemometers on three different sites were performed adopting the proposed approach. A cross-validation of the results of the proposed method against on-site wind speed measurement data indicates a good agreement. The results show that the approach proposed have reproduced a wind resource map with high resolution and the wind speed estimations for one spot within the wind farm are with a root-mean-square error of 0.399 m/s, which is qualified for wind farm planning in complex terrain.},

Meteodyn uses Navier-Stokes equations while making the calculations. This study is focused on the wind mapping of a particular region called Kocatepe, Manisa. The reference meteorological data is supplied from a met mast 65 meters height, measured for one year time period. The wind characteristics of the site is investigated by using the meteorological wind data from wind sensors at 30m and 50m levels of the measurement mast, and the software calculates the wind parameters of the selected site.

Then, taking the mesoscale {NWP} parameters as input data, the wind velocities were predicted by the simulated flow fields during the period of the year 2010. Compared with the measured wind velocity, the yearly mean absolute error ({MAE}) of predicted wind velocity for each wind turbine is less than 2m/s, and as the {MAE} decreases, the number of wind velocity samples increases. It shows that wind velocity prediction by this {CFD} method is accurate. The research in this paper may provide support for the work of wind power forecasting.},

While the functional model enabling the estimation of floodwater damage is well-known and accurate, an equivalent concerning storms and winter-gales is non-existent. As state-of-the-art scientific findings revealed that the damage caused by intense winds strongly correlates to the local wind speed, the aim of this work is to model wind flow over an urban area to detect peaks concerning wind speed and air pressure gradients. The necessary prerequisites for wind modeling are a) a surface model and b) information about surface roughness. In this experiment this information is derived from data products delivered by remote sensing satellite missions, namely Cartosat-1 and {RapidEye}. The experiments were carried out for a subset of the city of Gelsenkirchen in Westphalia, Germany, covering 1500*1500 m2. The major steps described are a) the mesh generation from {DSM}, b) enrichment of the {DSM} with surface roughness parameters based on landuse data, c) running the modeling for the area of interest and d) analysis of the results. The experiment reveals that the given data sources satisfy the necessary accuracy for modeling channeling and deflection effects in urban environments.},

It brings out more readily the terms in the Navier-Stokes equations associated with different events and fluid structures of turbulent flows than the classic two component decomposition of Reynolds. In particular the new composition highlights the existence of two types of Reynolds stresses: fast and slow. The fast Reynolds stresses can be linked to a streaming process that describes the ejection of wall fluid in the bursting process. It also provides a simple method for modelling the wall layer. The four components are a long time average, a slow fluctuating component based on the difference between the long term average and the smoothed phase velocity developed by passing coherent structures, a fast fluctuating component which is periodic in nature and a streaming component created by the interaction between the fast fluctuations and the fluid viscous effects.},

	abstract = {In this visualisation the instantaneous local velocity is expressed in terms of four components to capture the development of and interactions between coherent structures in turbulent flows. It is then possible to isolate the terms linked with each major type of structure and identify the corresponding subsets of the Navier-Stokes equations that are easier to solve than the full version. Each of these subsets applies to a domain in the flow field not a flow regime. The traditional statistics of turbulence are shown to be not specific to turbulent flow. In particular the Reynolds stresses, the probability density function, the dissipation, the production and the energy spectrum are obtained from one subset associated with unsteady "laminar" flow. The evidence also indicates that the Kolmogorov scale does not represent an eddy size and more importantly that it does not require the assumption of local isotropy. Applications of this visualisation include a proposal for a theoretical closure of the Reynolds equations, the collapse of velocity and skin friction profiles for Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluid flows in all geometries into unique master curves. A new partial derivative is introduced that decouples the effect of diffusion and convection simplifying the mathematical solution of subsets of the {NS} equations with implications for a more efficient generation of computational fluid dynamics packages. Finally the consequences to turbulent heat and mass transfer are examined.},

The width of applicability of the model is demonstrated by reference to numerical computations of nine substantially different kinds of turbulent flow.},

The sensor had observed huge amount of stereo images all over the world during the mission life of the satellite from 2006 through 2011. We have semi-automatically processed Digital Surface Model ({DSM}) data with the image archives in some limited areas. The height accuracy of the dataset was estimated at less than 5m (rms) from the evaluation with ground control points ({GCPs}) or reference {DSMs} derived from the Light Detection and Ranging ({LiDAR}). Then, we decided to process the global {DSM} datasets from all available archives of {PRISM} stereo images by the end of March 2016. This paper briefly reports on the latest processing algorithms for the global {DSM} datasets as well as their preliminary results on some test sites. The accuracies and error characteristics of datasets are analyzed and discussed on various fields by the comparison with existing global datasets such as Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite ({ICESat}) data and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission ({SRTM}) data, as well as the {GCPs} and the reference airborne {LiDAR}/{DSM}.},

	abstract = {Reliable and accurate short-term prediction of wind speed at hub height is very important to optimize the integration of wind energy into existing electrical systems. To this end, a coupled model based on the Weather Research Forecasting ({WRF}) model and Open Source Field Operation and Manipulation ({OpenFOAM}) Computational Fluid Dynamics ({CFD}) model is proposed to improve the forecast of the wind fields over complex terrain regions. The proposed model has been validated with the quality-controlled observations of 15 turbine sites in a target wind farm in Japan. The numerical results show that the coupled model provides more precise forecasts compared to the {WRF} alone forecasts, with the overall improvements of 26\%, 22\% and 4\% in mean error ({ME}), root mean square error ({RMSE}) and correlation coefficient ({CC}), respectively. As the first step to explore further improvement of the coupled system, the polynomial chaos expansion ({PCE}) approach is adopted to quantitatively evaluate the effects of several parameters in the coupled model. The statistics from the uncertainty quantification results show that the uncertainty in the inflow boundary conditions to the {CFD} model affects more dominantly the hub-height wind prediction in comparison with other parameters in the turbulence model, which suggests an effective approach to parameterize and assimilate the coupling interface of the model.},

The new control method allows the user to simulate the effect of different wind speeds in one simulation by scaling a calibrated thrust coefﬁcient curve, while keeping the inﬂow constant. Since the global ﬂow is not changed, only the local ﬂow around the actuator disks need be recalculated from a previous converged result, which reduces the number of required iterations and computational effort by a factor of about 2–3.},

	abstract = {Accurate numerical simulation of wind field over complex terrain is an important prerequisite for wind resource assessment. In this study, numerical simulation of wind field over complex terrain was further carried out by taking the complex terrain around Siu Ho Wan station in Hong Kong as an example. By artificially expanding the original digital model data, Gambit and {ICEM} {CFD} software were used to create high-precision complex terrain model with high-quality meshing. The equilibrium atmospheric boundary layer simulation based on {RANS} turbulence model was carried out in a flat terrain domain, and the approximate inflow boundary conditions for the wind field simulation over complex terrain were established. Based on this, numerical simulations of wind field over complex terrain under different inflow wind directions were carried out. The numerical results were compared with the wind tunnel test and field measurement data for land and sea fetches. The results show that the numerical results are in good agreement with the wind tunnel data and the field measurement data which can verify the accuracy and reliability of the numerical simulation. The near ground wind field over complex terrain is complex and affected obviously by the terrain, and the wind field characteristics should be fully understood by numerical simulation when carrying out engineering application on it.},

	abstract = {An extended period numerical integration of a baroclinic primitive equation model has been made for the simulation and the study of the dynamics of the atmosphere's general circulation. The solution corresponding to external gravitational propagation is filtered by requiring the vertically integrated divergence to vanish identically. The vertical structure permits as dependent variables the horizontal wind at two internal levels and a single temperature, with the static stability entering as a parameter. The incoming radiation is a function of latitude only corresponding to the annual mean, and the outgoing radiation is taken to be a function of the local temperature. With the requirement for thermal equilibrium, the domain mean temperature is specified as a parameter. The role of condensation is taken into account only as it effectively reduces the static stability. All other external sources and sinks of heat are assumed to balance each other locally, and are thus omitted. The kinematics are that of a fluid on a sphere bounded by smooth zonal walls at the equator and at approximately 64° latitude. The dissipative sinks are provided by: (a) surface stresses proportional through a drag coefficient to the square of the surface wind which is suitably extrapolated from above, (b) internal convective stresses proportional to the vertical wind shear, and (c) lateral diffusion of momentum and heat through an exchange coefficient which depends on the local horizontal rate of strain—a horizontal length scale entering as the governing parameter. For a given specification of the parameters, an integration for 60 days has been made from initial conditions where random temperature disturbances have been superimposed on a zonally symmetric regime which is baroclinically unstable according to linear theory. This experiment not only displays the scale selective character of baroclinic instability, yielding zonal wave number 5 to 6, but also predicts an index or energy cycle. The period of this cycle is 11 to 12 days for the first 40 days of the experiment, then lengthening to 17 days while diminishing in amplitude during the latter part. The resulting mean zonal velocity profile is in good qualitative agreement with observation, but too intense, presumably because the effective static stability parameter is taken too large. Furthermore this profile is found to be no more than 5 percent super-geostrophic poleward of the angular momentum maximum and no more than 2 percent sub-geostrophic equatorward. The total zonal angular momentum remains constant to within 2 percent irrespective of the phase of the index cycle. This balance is controlled by the surface wind distribution which agrees quite well with observation. The poleward transport is mainly accomplished by the large-scale eddies, whereas the internal vertical flux is predominantly a transfer of the earth's angular momentum by the meridional circulation. The poleward heat transport is primarily accomplished by a Hadley circulation at low latitudes but by the large-scale horizontal eddies in mid-latitudes, where a Ferrel circulation tends to compensate through an equatorward flux. This compensation at mid-latitudes by an indirect meridional circulation is also quite evident, in the potential-kinetic energy transformations. Comparison of the momentum and heat transfer with observed data when available shows reasonably good quantitative agreement. The lateral transfer of momentum and heat by the non-linear diffusion, which parametrically is supposed to simulate the action of motions of sub-grid scale, accounts for a significant portion of the total eddy transfer. Although no direct comparison with the corresponding transfer in the real atmosphere is available, intuitively our small-scale diffusion appears to play too large a role. A diagnosis is made of the transformations among the baratropic and baroclinic parts of the kinetic energy as well as the zonal mean and zonal perturbation parts of the available potential and kinetic energy. This reveals the dominant paths that the energy passes through from source to ultimate sinks and the processes responsible for these transformations. It is found that the partitioning of dissipation by the energy components may differ considerably from estimates made from observation.},

	abstract = {We are concerned with the inviscid limit of the Navier-Stokes equations to the Euler equations in \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathbb \{R\}{\textasciicircum}3\}\$\$. We first observe that a pathwise Kolmogorov hypothesis implies the uniform boundedness of the αth-order fractional derivatives of the velocity for some α {\textgreater} 0 in the space variables in L2, which is independent of the viscosity μ {\textgreater} 0. Then it is shown that this key observation yields the L2-equicontinuity in the time variable and the uniform bound in Lq, for some q {\textgreater} 2, of the velocity independent of μ {\textgreater} 0. These results lead to the strong convergence of solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations to a solution of the Euler equations in \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathbb \{R\}{\textasciicircum}3\}\$\$. We also consider passive scalars coupled to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and, in this case, find the weak-star convergence for the passive scalars with a limit in the form of a Young measure (pdf depending on space and time). Not only do we offer a framework for mathematical existence theories, but also we offer a framework for the interpretation of numerical solutions through the identification of a function space in which convergence should take place, with the bounds that are independent of μ {\textgreater} 0, that is in the high Reynolds number limit.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the applications of the method of fundamental solutions ({MFS}) as a mesh-free numerical method for the Stokes’ first and second problems which prevail in the semi-infinite domain with constant and oscillatory velocity at the boundary in the fluid-mechanics benchmark problems. The time-dependent fundamental solutions for the semi-infinite problems are used directly to obtain the solution as a linear combination of the unsteady fundamental solution of the diffusion operator. The proposed numerical scheme is free from the conventional Laplace transform or the finite difference scheme to deal with the time derivative term of the governing equation. By properly placing the field points and the source points at a given time level, the solution is advanced in time until steady state solutions are reached. It is not necessary to locate and specify the condition at the infinite domain such as other numerical methods. Since the present method does not need mesh discretization and nodal connectivity, the computational effort and memory storage required are minimal as compared to the domain-oriented numerical schemes. Test results obtained for the Stokes’ first and second problems show good comparisons with the analytical solutions. Thus the present numerical scheme has provided a promising mesh-free numerical tool to solve the unsteady semi-infinite problems with the space-time unification for the time-dependent fundamental solution.},

Four main methods allowing for the reduction of memory usage and computational complexity are presented: hierarchical grids, tiles, and two techniques based on the indirect addressing (the fluid index array and the connectivity matrix). For parallel implementations, the advantages and disadvantages of the different methods of domain decomposition and workload balancing are discussed.},

By utilizing a level set approach for geometry embedding the method can handle rotating and moving structures effectively. The approach is validated for the canonical six degrees of freedom test case of a hinged wing. Subsequently, the wake field in an array of three Vestas V27 wind turbines at prescribed rotation rate and under constant inflow condition is simulated for two different scenarios. The results show that the low dissipation properties of the lattice Boltzmann scheme in combination with dynamic mesh adaptation are able to predict well-resolved vortex structures far downstream at moderate computational costs.},

Each section summarises an individual area of simulation and modelling, covering the important historical research findings and a comprehensive analysis of recent work. This segregated approach emphasises the key components of wind energy. Topics range in geometric scales and detail, ranging from atmospheric boundary layer modelling, to fatigue and fracture in the turbine blades. More recent studies have begun to combine a range of scales and physics to better approximate real systems and provide higher fidelity and accurate analyses to manufacturers and companies. This paper shows a clear trend towards coupling both scales and physics into singular models utilising high performance computing system.},
